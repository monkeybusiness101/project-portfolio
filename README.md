# project-portfolio

HTML and CSS portfolio site

This project has been fun and hard, especially timewise

I think that the project was a good way to start thinking about structure and reusable components. It was good practice for HTML, CSS and making it responsive

I should have started with a mobile view first

I got some good tips from my colleagues on structuring the site as boxes, with flexbox

I used chrome lighthouse and waves for accessibility
